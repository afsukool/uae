            <h2>History of the UAE Flag</h2>
            <p>The UAE flag was raised on December 2, 1971, for the first time by Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan to mark the country’s union.</p>
            <p>His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of UAE and Ruler of Dubai, has called upon Emiratis to celebrate Flag Day on November 3.</p>
            <p>The flag consists of four colours — green, white, black and red — which together represent the unity of Arabs.</p>
            <p>The flag was designed by a young Emirati, Abdullah Mohammad Al Maainah, after seeing an advertisement about a competition for designing it. He later went on to become the Minister of Foreign Affairs.</p>
            <h3>What do the colours mean?</h3>
            <p><strong>Red</strong>: Red represents hardiness, bravery, strength and courage. The vertical red band can also be interpreted as binding all the other meanings together in unity.</p>
            <p><strong>Green</strong>: Green represents hope, joy, optimism and love. It can also symbolise the country’s prosperity.</p>
            <p><strong>White</strong>: White represents peace and honesty. White is the purest colour, and is interpreted by some to symbolise cleanliness.</p>
            <p><strong>Black</strong>: Contrary to popular belief, the black band does not represent oil. It stands for the defeat of enemies, and also strength of mind.</p>
